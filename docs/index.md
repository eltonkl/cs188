# Brian Segmentation & Skull Stripping 

## Introduction

Skull stripping, which is one form of brain segmentation, refers to the 
process of isolating the brain from other structures in a medical image 
of the brain. This usually involves the removal of the skull and any other 
non-brain tissue from the image, such as the dura and scalp. It is often 
done as a pre-processing step as it is improves the speed and accuracy of 
many brain image analysis/processing algorithms, such as coregistration and 
tissue segmentation, while also decreasing algorithm complexity (Roy 2015). 
Skull stripped images have become a standard preliminary step for many 
brain image processing tools.
